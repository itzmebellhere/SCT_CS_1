# Task 1: Caesar Cipher Tool

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

## 📌 Task Description

Implement a Caesar Cipher tool that allows users to:
- Encrypt a message using a shift value.
- Decrypt a message using a shift value.

The tool is built as a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) program in Python.

## 🔧 Features

- User input for message and shift value
- Option to Encrypt or Decrypt
- Handles uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabet characters
- Command-line based (no GUI)

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itzmebellhere/SCT_CS_1.git

## Example
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? e
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3): 3
Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog
